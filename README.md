# Notes

## About

Notes is an application that puts encryption first. As such, it provides a test bed to solve the problems that arise from storing encrypted data. Currently in beta, you can test it out with a [keybase](https://keybase.io) account at [notes.digital](https://notes.digital). All data is currently stored locally only, completely on a user's device.
